Description: this javascript file contains the following three commands for the jw-bot in GA_JS_DTLA.

Commands: please refer to the comments below which will describe and provide instructions for running the three commands.


1. jw-bot's first functionality is responding with an image link of the course roadmap and deadlines.
      Slack will often unfurl the link as an embedded image.

      Instructions: a) type 'course roadmap and deadlines' into the general slackroom.
                    or
                    b) direct message 'course roadmap and deadlines' to jw-bot.

2. jw-bot's second functionality is replying directly to the user (and notifying them) with the exit ticket.

      Instructions: a) type '@jw-bot YOURSLACKNAME needs the exit ticket' into the general slackroom (e.g. '@jw-bot jason needs the exit ticket')
                    or
                    b) direct message 'YOURSLACKNAME needs the exit ticket' to jw-bot.

                    Conditional - if user types 'jw-bot' as their slack name, bot will not return exit ticket.

3. jw-bot's third functionality is responding to the user with random motivational quotes, whenever they feel stuck!

        Instructions: a) direct message 'I need a pep talk!' to jw-bot. jw-bot will respond with a random quote.
